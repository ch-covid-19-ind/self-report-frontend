We also believe that hackers are also humans and therefore will not ethically involve in such actions.",
      "othersQuestion7": "Who are the developers and why are they doing it, of course there should be some financial motivation behind your application right?",
      "othersResponse7": "Good question ! To know the developers involved visit our github page: https://github.com/orgs/ch-covid-19/people (some of them have not enabled public view, you cannot view them unless you join our team). Our team is growing everyday. We have translators, designers, and coders, so on. We are spending out time and effort on this web application without expecting anything in return. In some sense you could see our work as donation for covid-19 financial crisis. Most of us have full-time job and we are working in the evenings, weekends to bring this to you for your benefit. The data is publicly available. Therefore, our motive and goal is to provide transperant data to the people and the government unlike other websites which take data from you and do not publish the data."
